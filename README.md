# Selenium

Welcome to the Selenium project!

Our goal is to enhance the _WPF_ programming experience by using an _implicit reactive programming_ model provided by the
[_Fluor_](https://github.com/Eric-W0/Fluor) framework.

Essentially, _Selenium_ = _WPF_ - _XAML_ + _Fluor_.

All the latest news/documentation can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/Eric-W0/Selenium/wiki/Home) home page. Have a look!
